Today, .NET developers can use freely available tools with a minimal performance overhead to monitor their application performance: CPU utilization, blocked threads, memory usage, and garbage collection metrics. In this workshop we will explore the rich world of ETW through free tools such as the Windows Performance Toolkit and PerfView. We will also see how to produce ETW logs from .NET applications and how to monitor ETW data in real-time from .NET code.","time":"09:00 - 17:00","num":0},{"day":1,"title":"Modern .NET Debugging","speaker":"Ofir Makmal","slot":1,"track":1,"level":300,"prerequisites":"None","abstract":"In the modern day and age, debugging managed applications is no longer just about Visual Studio. In this workshop, we will explore modern tools for debugging .NET applications in production.

It probably does. But do not despair, as you are not alone – in fact, the DevOps community has solutions for you! In this session we'll talk about Vagrant and Packer, two open-source tools that can make sure your environment and hand-off issues will become a thing of the past.","time":"12:10 - 13:10","num":23}]},"4":{"time":"14:10 - 15:10","sessions":[{"day":3,"title":"What's New in C# 6","speaker":"Elad Avneri","slot":4,"track":8,"level":300,"prerequisites":"None","abstract":"TBD","time":"14:10 - 15:10","num":24},{"day":3,"title":"Modern Responsive Web Design","speaker":"Noam Kfir","slot":4,"track":6,"level":200,"prerequisites":"Web development experience","abstract":"TBD","time":"14:10 - 15:10","num":25},{"day":3,"title":"TBD","speaker":"TBD","slot":4,"track":7,"level":200,"prerequisites":"None","abstract":"TBD","time":"14:10 - 15:10","num":26}]},"5":{"time":"15:30 - 16:30","sessions":[{"day":3,"title":"Performance in Chrome DevTools","speaker":"Sebastian Pederiva","slot":5,"track":6,"level":300,"prerequisites":"Web development experience","abstract":"TBD","time":"15:30 - 16:30","num":27},{"day":3,"title":"TBD","speaker":"TBD","slot":5,"track":7,"level":200,"prerequisites":"None","abstract":"TBD","time":"15:30 - 16:30","num":28},{"day":3,"title":"Visual Studio Performance and Diagnostics Hub","speaker":"Sasha Goldshtein","slot":5,"track":8,"level":300,"prerequisites":"None","abstract":"The recent versions of Visual Studio introduce more and more tools for analyzing the performance of your applications.
